                The capital city of South Korea, Seoul is a vibrant city where historical sites and beautiful skyscrapers coexist in perfect harmony. The city is home to some of the most beautiful royal palaces occupied by the royal families of old as well as towering buildings. There also exists an indoor theme park and vibrant markets. The people of Seoul are very fashionable as well as welcoming. I have learnt a lot about this city through watching a lot of Korean dramas so itâ€™s only natural that the final step would be to travel to and experience the city for myself.
